# A Maven project with MyBatis, JSF, CDI for Apache Tomcat

You don't need JPA for your Java EE applications. MyBatis is a great
replacement if you prefer a more database centric development. I have build
several projects using this stack.

This is a demo project. Helps to setup things more easily.
